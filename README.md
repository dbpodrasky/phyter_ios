# pHyter for iOS

Official iOS application for the pHyter pH measurement tool.

## Getting Started

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is used for dependencies, so [install](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) it before proceeding.

To fetch and build the project dependencies, run: `carthage update --platform iOS`. This can take a while, so be patient.

## Running the app

The default schemes are included. The app also supports a 'demo mode', which you can run by setting `DemoMode=YES` in your launch scheme.
